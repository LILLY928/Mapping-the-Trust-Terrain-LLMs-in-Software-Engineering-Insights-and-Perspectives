# Overview
This repository contains the data and code for the paper *Mapping the Trust Terrain: LLMs in Software Engineering - Insights and Perspectives*. Our study explores the definition, conceptualization, and measurement of trust using LLMs in software engineering.

We began with a systematic literature review of 14 papers from Software Engineering, Deep Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction to assess the current research on trust concepts. Following this, we surveyed 25 domain experts to gather practitioners' perspectives on trust.

This repository provides all our data to ensure reproducibility and to encourage community contributions to promote trust in LLMs in software engineering.
